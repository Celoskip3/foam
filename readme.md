## Brain

I want to build a second brain, but I also want to own my brain.

- Roam research is cool, and has a lot of good features
- But they're also reimplementing a text browser on the web
- I'm sure in the long run there's a bunch of things they can do with it
- But maybe so could a VSCode editor?

## Second brain in VSCode
- [x] Light editor theme
- [x] Markdown All In One plugin set
  - [x] List indentation
  - [x] Keyboard shortcuts
  - [x] Checklists (alt-c)
- [x] Using GitLens hover annotations to remember when changes were made
  - [ ] Maybe do something cool with [gitlens modes](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/tree/master/#modes-)
  - [ ] Quick commit all files

This is a collection of [random thoughts](random_thoughts.md).
