# Daily notes

Daily notes is a Zettelkasten methodology for journaling your thoughts and keeping track of the evolution of your thoughts. We should support it.

## Ideas

- Hotkey for creating daily note instead of auto creating? I don't like how Roam creates empty notes.
- Browsing daily notes could be tricky. Maybe we could do it with just back links and creating a daily file with a reference to a "Journal page" that then links to all the daily entries.
  - If files were named in alphabetic sortable order, and back links would display in reverse order, newest would always come on top
- Is this a use case for a directory?
