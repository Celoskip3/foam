# Roadmap

Some of these items can be achieved by combining existing tools, but others may require us to build bespoke software solutions. See [[build-vs-assemble]] to understand trade-offs between these approaches.

## In progress

Items that are already being worked on. Roadmap items in this stage should have an owner.

- (Empty list)

## High priority

Items we plan on working next. Items in this stage should **not** have an owner, but should have enough specification work that they can be picked up and worked on without seeking consensus.

You should not pick up work in this category without having a plan on how long the implementation should approximately take.

## Backlog

Everything else, categorised into themes. Just because something is on this list doesn't mean it'll get done. If you're interested in working on items in this category, check the [[contribution-guide]] for how to get started.

If a roadmap item is a stub, **consider** opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues) to start a conversation to avoid situations where the implementation does not fit long term vision and roadmap. _Note that this is optional. The only centralised governance in Foam is to decide what ends up in the official [template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template), [documentation](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) and [extension](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-vscode). You are free to build whatever you want for yourself, and we'd love if you shared it with us, but you are by no means obligated to do so!_
