# Roadmap

The below Foam roadmap is ~approximately prioritised. We don't need to work on things in this exact order, but generally items closer to the top are higher priority than items towards the bottom.

Some of these items can be achieved by combining existing tools, but others may require us to build bespoke software solutions. See [Build vs Assemble](build-vs-assemble.md) to understand tradeoffs between these approaches.
