- Release notes
- Automatic updates
- Foam should tick at the same frequency as your brain, and the Foam graph you build should match the mental model you have in your head, making navigation effortless.
  - Maps have persistent topologies. As the graph grows, you should be able to visualise where an idea belongs. Maybe a literal map? And island? A DeckGL visualisation?
- Write about the history and process of Foam
  - In ways, Wallet was the first iteration of Foam-like environment
- Should we support directories?
  - Some tools might get more complicated to build
  - The pressure to categorize and create hierachies can become distracting
  - Is there value in folderizing?
  - Use case: Writing docs in a codebase
- Future architecture
  - Could we do publish-related settings as a pre-push git hook, e.g. generating footnote labels
- Looking at the errors/warnings/output panes makes me think, what kind of automated quality tools could we write.
  - Deduplication, finding similarities...
  - Thought Debugger?
  - Foam Compiler!
