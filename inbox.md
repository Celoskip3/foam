- Foam is a work in progress
  - [[contributing]]
  - [[roadmap]] shows some of the features I think we could build
  - I'm far more excited about all the things we haven't even thought of yet
    - Learning from others' experience and integrating good ideas and tools into my own workflow
- Foam should tick at the same frequency as your brain, and the Foam graph you build should match the mental model you have in your head, making navigation effortless.
- In ways, Wallet was the first iteration of Foam-like environment
- Should we support directories?
  - Some tools might get more complicated to build
  - The pressure to categorize and create hierachies can become distracting
  - Is there value in folderizing?
- This readme repo is in some ways the Foam project's on Foam! It should be more collaborative.
- Could we do publish-related settings as a pre-push git hook, e.g. generating footnote labels
- Back links as meta data are cool, but should we support "materialised" back links
