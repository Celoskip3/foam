## Random thoughts

- Could build/use a generic mobile app that can edit markdown in a GitHub repo
- Build a custom action toolbar
- Foam, Faux Roam
- Foam pages could be called Bubbles
- Maybe call it Foam while it's no-code (Faux roam), and once it's its own language/extension, give it a different name
- Use Git history to get more context on what you were working on when
  -  Add metadata like "Raw thoughts", or "Meeting with John"
  -  Roll back changes
- Collect @TODO, @REVIEW etc annotations from you graph to create a todo list
