# TODO

## What can we already do without any custom code?

- [x] Light editor theme
- [x] Markdown All In One plugin set
  - [x] File name autocompletiong for links
  - [x] List indentation
  - [x] Keyboard shortcuts
  - [x] Checklists (alt-c)
  - [x] Cmd+Click file name to navigate to it
- [x] Using GitLens hover annotations to remember when changes were made
  - [ ] Maybe do something cool with [gitlens modes](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/tree/master/#modes-)
- [x] Git automator
  - [x] Cmd+Shift+A to add all files
  - [x] Cmd+Shift+Z to push all commits
  - [ ] Automatic commit messages (TODO, see Git Automator readme)

## How to make my setup usable for others without code
- [ ] Template workspace/repo to clone
  - [ ] GitHub has a feature for this
- [ ] Comes with a `.vscode/settings.json`
  - [ ] Recommended plugins
    - [ ] Markdown all in one
    - [ ] Some editor theme
    - [ ] Git Lens
    - [ ] Git Automator
  - [ ] Custom shortcuts (if possible in workspace?)
