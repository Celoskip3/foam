# Contribution Guide

> [[todo]] [[good-first-task]] This contribution guide itself could be improved ðŸ˜…

Foam is open to contributions of any kind, including but not limited to code, documentation, ideas and feedback. Here's how to get started on contributing to Foam:

- Use Foam for yourself, figure out what could be improved.
- Check out [[roadmap]] to see what's already in the plans. I have thoughts about how to implement some of these, but open to ideas and code contributions!
- Read about our [[principles]] to understand Foam's philosophy and direction
- Read and act in accordance of our [[code-of-conduct]].
- Feel free to open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues) to give me feedback and ideas for new features.
- Submit improvements as pull requests:
  - Documentation and [[recipes]] at [foambubble/foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam
  - To the starter template at [foambubble/foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)
  - To the core VSCode plugin at [foambubble/foam-vscode](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)
  - To future Foam automations at [foambubble/foam-workspace/manager](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) (though at the moment this is probably too early to contribute to, as there's no architecture in place)
  - Any other of the [[recommended-extensions]] in their respective GitHub repos.
