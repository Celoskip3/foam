# Referencing notes by title

- Currently we reference notes with `[Description](desription.md)` syntax.
  - Pros
    - Supported by all static site generators
    - Supported by Markdown All in One
  - Cons
    - Unergonomic to write
    - Knowing file name should not be important
    - Makes [Unlinked references](unlinked_references.md) harder
    - Makes [Renaming references](renaming_notes.md) harder
- Possible syntaxes
  - `[Title of page]`
    - Pro: Already supported by Markdown and GH Pages publishing
    - Con: Possibly syntactically ambiguous
  - `[[Title of page]]`
    - Pros: Roam format, syntactically more specific
    - Cons: Not valid Markdown?
  - Keep current syntax, but automate linking, e.g. a snippet/shortcut to:
    - Insert `[]()` (opens file autocompletion)
    - Once file is chosen in `()`, populate the description in `[]` automatically from page tite
    - Pros: Compatible with Markdown All in One
    - Cons: Not as sleek as other options
- Can [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) help us here?
