# Renaming files

- We should be able to rename a page and the associated file easily
- Should update references everywhere
  - This would be easier if we supported [[referencing-notes-by-title]]
- Even if we use only titles, names matter for
  - Cmd+P navigation
  - Finding content outside of a Foam environment
  - Publish page urls

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[referencing-notes-by-title]: referencing-notes-by-title "Referencing notes by title"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
