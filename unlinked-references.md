# Unlinked references

One of Roam's big features is the ability to find all instances of a reference, create a page for it and update all the references to link to the new page.

Implementing this is on the [[roadmap]], but for the time being you can:

- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `F` to find all the references, e.g. "Cat food"
- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `H` to replace them with [[cat-food]].
- Click any of the references to create a new note.
