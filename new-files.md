# New files

Creating new files should be as easy as referencing it and then clicking on it. File should automatically have `# Title` element.

## Workaround

Currently, you can click an non-existing markdown file link and it'll show a dialog at bottom left corner with an "create file" button. Not perfect, but tenable for now.
