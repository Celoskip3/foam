# Publishing pages

Would be cool if Foam pages could be published. Some ideas here. 

- [x] Easymode: Make your GitHub public
- [x] Static site generator integration, publish from GH actions to GitHub pages / Netlify etc!!!
  - [ ] Add annotations to pages for setting visibility (many ways to do this)
    - [ ] Public by default, and `@private` annotations
    - [ ] Private by default, and `@public` annotations
    - [ ] Only public `/public` folder, just move a document there, no annotation needed
    - [ ] More granular access control? Email someone a link with a hash? [Testing](testing.md )
