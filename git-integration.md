# Git integration

There are (too) many ways to commit your changes to source control:

- Using VS Code's own git integration
- Using GitLens (included in Foam for inline blame)
- Whatever way you like to do it (CLI?)

The quick and easy way is to use [Git Automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit):

- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `A` to stage and commit all files
- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `Z` to commit current file
- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `X` to push all changes to remote repository

This could be improved. [[todo]] [[good-first-task]]

[todo]: todo "Todo"
[good-first-task]: good-first-task "Good First Task"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
