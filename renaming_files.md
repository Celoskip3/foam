# Renaming files

- We should be able to rename a page and the associated file easily
- Should update references everywhere
  - This would be easier if we supported [Referencing notes by title](referencing_notes_by_title.md)
- Even if we use only titles, names matter for 
  - Cmd+P navigation
  - Finding content outside of a Foam environment
  - Publish page urls
